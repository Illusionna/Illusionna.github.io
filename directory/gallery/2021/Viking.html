            <p>I was on the hill behind the village taking care for my sheep.</p>
            <p>I could see the small village to the South.</p>
            <p>Beyond the village I could see the town, which had just been built.</p>
            <p>This town had been built because we had heard about the Vikings.</p>
            <p>They had attacked and destroyed a village to the North.</p>
            <p>In this town, we could store our valuables and the people could shelter.</p>
            <p>There was a stronger wind blowing from the North, and I watched the waves dash against the rocks.</p>
            <p>So out at sea, I could see a tiny object.</p>
            <p>At first I thought it was a lot of our returning fishing boats.</p>
            <p>But as it came closer I could see a brightly coloured sail.</p>
            <p>It was a Viking ship.</p>
            <p>There was no time to lose.</p>
            <p>I must leave the sheep, and warn the the villagers were coming.</p>
            <p>To all the farmers I met I shouted, the Vikings are coming.</p>
            <p>They ran with me to the village.</p>
            <p>In the village people began to panic.</p>
            <p>Mothers ran to collect, babies and small children.</p>
            <p>Children and the old were crying.</p>
            <p>Then all the mothers and children and elderly hurried to the town for safety.</p>
            <p>Fathers and sons picked up the weapons.</p>
            <p>Our leader shouted, victory to the Saxons.</p>
            <p>Down with the Vikings.</p>
            <p>And we sit off to the beach to flight with the Vikings.</p>
            <p>We fought bravely.</p>
            <p>Many Saxons died.</p>
            <p>But more of our men went on the beach in case any Vikings came out of the sea.</p>
            <p>The sea was red with blood.</p>
            <p>The noise of swords clashing and cries of pain had stopped.</p>
            <p>The Vikings who were no killed had swum back to their ship.</p>
            <p>We won, but what would happened next time.</p>
